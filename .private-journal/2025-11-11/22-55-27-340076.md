## Project Notes

nosflare project uses vendor-specific NostrFilter extensions heavily:
- filter.sort.field and filter.sort.dir for video sorting (loop_count, likes, etc)
- filter.cursor for keyset pagination
- filter.verification for ProofMode filtering  
- filter['int#field_name'] for integer comparisons (int#likes, int#loop_count)

These are validated and used in video-queries.ts and durable-object.ts. The types should explicitly define these to maintain type safety, especially since the codebase uses validateSortField() and other validation functions that expect specific structures.

Pattern: NostrFilter extensions should be explicit optional properties, then catch-all for unknown extensions.
