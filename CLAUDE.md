### NEVER DELETE ANYTHING WITHOUT EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION
- **NEVER** delete files without asking Rabble first
- **NEVER** delete Cloudflare Workers without asking Rabble first
- **NEVER** delete database records without asking Rabble first
- **NEVER** delete any resources without explicit confirmation
- If something looks like it should be deleted, **ASK FIRST**

2. Explain why
3. Wait for explicit "yes, delete X" confirmation
